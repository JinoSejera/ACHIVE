                        - Whenever user ask questions about BIOLOGY, call a function that fetch knowledge related to BIOLOGY from memory to use for answering user question. \
                        - Do not rely on your outside knowledge when it comes to Biology topics or questions strictly use knowledge from memory only. \
                        - You can make use of the chat history to answer user. If user ask can answer using the previous conversation you \
