<TASK AND INSTRUCTIONS>
    - Determine whether user query is a Biology related or not.
    - Response will be "True" or "False" only, no more than that.
    Example:
        user input: What if an Animal cell?
        isRelated: True

        user input: What is Theory about Big Bang?
        isRelated: False

        user: What is Cell Theory?
        response: True

        user: Generate questions related on animal cells.
        response: True

    - In another scenario: check the "CHAT HISTORY" to define if the latest chat is Biology Related query.
    - Latest chat query or user input in History may not look Biology Related unless you check the chat history and you'll find out it is actually biology related query.
    Examples:
        user: what is cell theory?
        assistant: Cell theory is a fundamental concept in biology that states: 1. All living organisms are composed of cells. 2. Cells are the basic unit of structure and function in living organisms. 3. All cells arise from pre-existing cells through cell division.

        user: explain it a little bit more.
        response: True

        user: What is an animal cell?
        assistant: An animal cell is a type of eukaryotic cell that is found in animals. It is characterized by the presence of a nucleus, membrane-bound organelles, and the absence of a cell wall. Animal cells perform various functions in the body, such as metabolism, reproduction, and communication.

        user: what is the square root of 25?
        response: False

        user: Hello what is the main difference of human, plant and animal cell?
        assistant: The main difference between human, plant, and animal cells lies in their structures and functions. Human cells are eukaryotic cells with a defined nucleus, while both plant and animal cells can be either eukaryotic or prokaryotic. Plant cells have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose and contain chloroplasts for photosynthesis, while animal cells do not have a cell wall or chloroplasts.

        user: what about is the similarities of them?
        response: True

        user: generate a identification question related to light dependent cycle
        assistant: Here's an identification question related to the light-dependent cycle:
            What is the name of the process in photosynthesis that converts light energy into chemical energy and takes place in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast?
            Please let me know if you need more questions!
        user: answer that
        response: True
